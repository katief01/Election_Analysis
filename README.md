## Overview of Election Audit
  The purpose of this election audit analysis is to provide a detailed breakdown of elction results which includes individual candidate names, number of votes per candidate, percentage of votes per candidate as well as the overall winner.  An additional audit analysis allowed us to include voter turnout per county, percentage of votes per county, and the county with the largest turnout, for a quick snapshot of overall election results.  

## Election Audit Results
* In total, 369, 711 votes were cast in this congressional election.
* As displayed in the election_analysis text file created for this analysis, the breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct is noted here (analysis/election_analysis.txt):
    Jefferson: 10.5% (38,855)
    Denver: 82.8% (306,055)
    Arapahoe: 6.7% (24,801)
* As seen in the above breakdown, Denver, by far, had the largest voter turnout of the three counties in the election.
* Also noted in the election_analysis text file is a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received (analysis/election_analysis.txt):
    Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)
    Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)
    Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)
* Diana DeGette is the clear winner of this congressional election with 272,292 votes which was 73.8% of the total number of votes.

## Election Audit Summary
  When we execute the script created in this module, we're able to view the names of the individual candidates, each candidate's results, the percentage of votes they received, and the winning candidate summary in an easy to read text file. The output of the script creates an organized breakdown of almost 370,000 votes for three different candidates in three different counties. Additionally, for this challenge, we were able to use repetition statements, conditional statements with logical operators, and print statements to view the candidate votes with percentages as well as individual county votes, the percentages for each county, and the county with the largest voter turnout. We're able to see that Denver had the largest voter turnout with 306,055 (82.8%) of the total votes. 

  The script used for this election audit analysis can also be used, with modification, for any type of election. Variables can be created to work with any number of candidates, county or state names, or total number of votes.  Additional print statements can also be used to present output for any amount of detail needed to analyze a particual election result. 
  
  In summary, an audit analysis in Python is an excellent tool to create a quick snapshot of large amounts of data such as those found in congressional election results.
